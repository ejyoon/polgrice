Summary of experimental results

- Adults infer that a “polite” speaker’s utterance may represent the world associated with the listener more positively than the actual state
- Adults dissociate between goals to be honest, nice and mean
    * “polite” utterances emphasize the goal to be nice and less so the goal to be honest and mean
    * goal to be polite: increases with positivity of valence of utterance
    * goal to be honest: state-utterance match
    * goal to be mean: increases with negativity of valence of utterance (but to a lower extent for negative states)
- Adults report that they might ask for an honest speaker’s opinion, but like a polite person better
