\section{Proposed main work}
\label{sec:proposed}

I now take up the challenge of developing the RSA framework to
broaden its scope and address the weaknesses described above.
Subsections correspond to the broad goals described in
\secref{sec:intro}. Each has a common format: a review of the
limitations of the current RSA framework and then descriptions of the
theoretical extensions we plan to explore and our proposed empirical
tests of the theory.
